Deadlock can arise if the following four conditions hold simultaneously (Necessary Conditions)
Mutual Exclusion: One or more than one resource are non-shareable (Only one process can use at a time)
Hold and Wait: A process is holding at least one resource and waiting for resources.
No Preemption: A resource cannot be taken from a process unless the process releases the resource.
Circular Wait: A set of processes are waiting for each other in circular form.
